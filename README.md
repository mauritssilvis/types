# Types

> A collection of data types and structures, implemented in different programming languages

## Introduction

With this project, I provide implementations of commonly used data types and structures in different programming languages.

Below, I first describe the [aims](#1-aims) I have with the current project.
I then provide an [overview](#2-overview) of the data type and structure implementations that are currently available.
Finally, I provide some [background information](#3-background) on the data types and structures I focus on in this project.

## 1. Aims

My aims with this project are to:

- Build up knowledge of data types and structures.
- Learn how these data types and structures can be implemented.

More generally, I strive to:

- Gain experience with different programming languages.
- Get to know the specifics of these languages.

Finally, I aim to:

- Showcase this experience and knowledge.

## 2. Overview

Currently, implementations of commonly used data types and structures are available in:

- [Java](java)
  
TODO: Provide a type x language matrix of the data type and structure implementations.

## 3. Background

More information on the data types and structures that I focus on in this project is given in what follows.

### 3.1 String

TODO: Introduce the string data type.
