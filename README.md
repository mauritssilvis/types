# Types

> A collection of data types and structures, implemented in different programming languages

## About

With this repository, I provide implementations of commonly used data types and structures in different programming languages.

## Aims

My general aims are to

* gain experience with different programming languages; and
* get to know the specifics of these languages.
  
With this repository, I particularly strive to

* build up knowledge of data types and structures; and
* learn how these types and structures can be implemented.
  
Finally, I aim to

* showcase this experience and knowledge.
