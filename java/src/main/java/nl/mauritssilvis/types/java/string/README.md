> The string data type, implemented in Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Types > Java](../../../../../../../..) project, I provide implementations of the string data type in Java.

Below, I give an overview of the different [implementations](#1-implementations) I considered.

General information about the string data type can be found in the [string section](../../../../../../../../../README.md#31-string) of the general [project readme](../../../../../../../../../README.md).

## 1. Implementations

### 1.1 Immutable strings

First, I focus on immutable string types that implement the interface from the file [ImmutableString.java](ImmutableString.java):

```java
package nl.mauritssilvis.types.java.string;

public interface ImmutableString {
    int getLength();

    boolean isEmpty();

    char getChar(int index);

    char[] toCharArray();
}
```

Objects of the above type know about their length, allow for random access of the characters they contain and can be converted to character arrays.
No methods are supplied that can change an object's contents.

#### 1.1.1 An array of characters

One of the ways in which the above immutable string interface can be implemented relies on the use of an array of characters. Such an implementation is provided in the file [ArrayString.java](ArrayString.java), which in a condensed form looks as follows:

```java
package nl.mauritssilvis.types.java.string;

// Import statements

public class ArrayString implements ImmutableString {
    private final char[] chars;

    // A no-argument constructor and constructors accepting
    // char[], ImmutableString or regular Java String objects

    // Methods implementing the ImmutableString interface 

    // Methods overriding some methods of the Object class
}
```

Unit tests confirm the functioning of this immutable string implementation.
