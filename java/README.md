# Java types

> A collection of data types and structures implemented in Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Types](..) project, I provide implementations of commonly used data types and structures in Java.

Below, I give an [overview](#1-overview) of the available implementations.

## 1. Overview

Currently, (partial) Java implementations of the following data types and structures are available:

| Data type or structure                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [String](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string)                                   |
| • [Immutable string](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string/#11-immutable-strings) |
