> A collection of data types and structures, implemented in Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Types](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/types) project, I provide implementations of commonly used data types and structures in Java.

Below, I give an [overview](#1-overview) of the available Java implementations of data types and structures.

## 1. Overview

Currently, (partial) Java implementations of the following data types and structures are available:

| Data type or structure                                                 |  
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [String](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string)             |
| [• Immutable string](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string) |
