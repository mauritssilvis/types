# Java types

> A collection of data types and structures implemented in Java

## Introduction

With this part of the [Types](https://github.com/mauritssilvis/types) project, I provide implementations of commonly used data types and structures in Java.

Below, I give an [overview](#overview) of the available implementations.

## Overview

Currently, (partial) Java implementations of the following data types and structures are available:

- [String](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string)

  - [Immutable string](src/main/java/nl/mauritssilvis/types/java/string#11-immutable-strings)
